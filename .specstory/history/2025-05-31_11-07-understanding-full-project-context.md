Based on my exploration of the project, here's a comprehensive overview of the Waste Platform application:

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js-based waste management platform that combines web3 technology with practical environmental solutions. The application allows users to report waste, collect waste, earn rewards, and track their environmental impact.

## Core Features
1. **Waste Reporting**: Users can report waste by uploading images which are analyzed using Google's Gemini AI to identify waste type and quantity.

2. **Waste Collection**: Allows users to view reported waste and collect it, with verification through image uploads.

3. **Rewards System**: Users earn points for reporting and collecting waste, which are tracked on a blockchain.

4. **Verification Process**: AI-powered verification of waste reports and collections using image analysis.

5. **User Dashboard**: Shows impact metrics like waste collected, CO2 offset, and rewards earned.

6. **Leaderboard**: Tracks and displays top contributors.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Web3Auth
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini for image analysis
- **Maps**: Google Maps API for location selection
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia testnet)
- **Smart Contracts**: Using OpenZeppelin, Chainlink, Hardhat

## Database Schema
Contains tables for:
- Users
- Reports (waste reports)
- Rewards
- CollectedWastes
- Notifications
- Transactions

## User Flow
1. Users authenticate using Web3Auth
2. They can report waste with location, images, and details
3. Other users can collect reported waste
4. Both reporting and collecting earn rewards
5. A verification system ensures honesty in reporting and collection

## Key Components
- Web3 integration for blockchain-based rewards
- AI-powered verification of waste reports
- Geolocation for mapping waste
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Reward system to incentivize participation

The project represents a modern approach to waste management by combining technology, incentives, and community participation to address environmental challenges.

_**User**_

I want to add one more feature ,should i tell you

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, please go ahead and tell me about the feature you'd like to add! I can help you brainstorm how to implement it, suggest where it might fit in the existing codebase, and provide guidance on the necessary changes. Let me know what you have in mind!

---

_**User**_

when our collection is succufull ,check @collect , then we want to send this collected report in email which will contain that image uploaded, summary and location all these things which we have in collected and reported waste. how can i do this

---

_**Assistant**_

To implement email notifications for successful waste collection, you can follow these steps. We'll use `nodemailer` (which is already in your `package.json`) to send emails. Here's how you can modify the `src/app/collect/page.tsx` file to include this feature:

### Step 1: Create an Email Template
First, create a function that generates the email content using the collected waste data.

```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...

const generateEmailContent = (task: CollectionTask, imageUrl: string) => {
  return `
    <h1>Waste Collection Report</h1>
    <p>Here are the details of the waste collection:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> ${task.location}</li>
      <li><strong>Waste Type:</strong> ${task.wasteType}</li>
      <li><strong>Amount:</strong> ${task.amount}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Image of the collected waste:</p>
    <img src="${imageUrl}" alt="Collected Waste" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p>Thank you for contributing to a cleaner environment!</p>
  `;
};
```

### Step 2: Add Email Sending Logic
Next, add a function to send the email using `nodemailer`. You'll need to configure your email service (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid) in the `.env` file.

```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...

const sendCollectionEmail = async (task: CollectionTask, imageUrl: string) => {
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail', // or your email service
    auth: {
      user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
      pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,
    },
  });

  const mailOptions = {
    from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    to: 'recipient@example.com', // Replace with the recipient's email
    subject: 'Waste Collection Report',
    html: generateEmailContent(task, imageUrl),
  };

  try {
    await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
    console.log('Email sent successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending email:', error);
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Trigger Email on Successful Collection
Finally, call the `sendCollectionEmail` function when the collection is successfully verified.

```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...

const handleVerify = async () => {
  if (!selectedTask || !verificationImage || !user) {
    toast.error('Missing required information for verification.');
    return;
  }

  // Add check to prevent re-verification of already verified tasks
  if (selectedTask.status === 'verified') {
    toast.error('This task has already been verified and rewarded.');
    return;
  }

  setVerificationStatus('verifying');
  setVerificationError(null);
  setIsProcessing(true);
  setVerificationAttempts(prev => prev + 1);
  
  try {
    if (!geminiApiKey) {
      throw new Error('Gemini API key is missing');
    }
    
    // Use the centralized analyzeWasteImage function
    const result = await analyzeWasteImage(
      geminiApiKey,
      verificationImage,
      {
        expectedWasteType: selectedTask.wasteType,
        expectedQuantity: selectedTask.amount,
        strictMode: true, // Use strict mode for collection verification
        mode: 'collect'
      }
    );
    
    setVerificationResult(result);
    setVerificationStatus('success');
    
    // STRICTER VERIFICATION LOGIC:
    // Only checking waste type match as per requirements
    const isVerified = result.matches?.wasteTypeMatch === true;
    
    if (isVerified) {
      try {
        // Save the collected waste first with the full verification result
        await saveCollectedWaste(selectedTask.id, user.id, verificationImage, result);

        // Send email notification
        await sendCollectionEmail(selectedTask, verificationImage);

        // ... rest of the existing code ...
```

### Step 4: Update `.env` File
Add your email credentials to the `.env` file:

```plaintext:.env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

### Summary of Changes
1. **Email Template**: Created a function to generate the email content.
2. **Email Sending Logic**: Added a function to send the email using `nodemailer`.
3. **Trigger Email**: Called the email sending function after successful waste collection verification.
4. **Environment Variables**: Added email credentials to the `.env` file.

This implementation will send an email with the collected waste details, including the image, location, and summary, whenever a collection is successfully verified.

_**User**_

so i dont have to create any serviec like on nodemailer , i just need to put my email and pass in env?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that's correct! You don't need to create a separate service for `nodemailer`. You can directly configure it in your code by adding your email credentials (email and password) to the `.env` file. Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Update `.env` File
Add your email credentials to the `.env` file:

```plaintext:.env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

### Step 2: Use `nodemailer` in Your Code
You can use `nodemailer` directly in your `src/app/collect/page.tsx` file. Here's the relevant part of the code:

```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
const sendCollectionEmail = async (task: CollectionTask, imageUrl: string) => {
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail', // or your email service
    auth: {
      user: process.env.EMAIL_USER, // Use the email from .env
      pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD, // Use the password from .env
    },
  });

  const mailOptions = {
    from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    to: 'recipient@example.com', // Replace with the recipient's email
    subject: 'Waste Collection Report',
    html: generateEmailContent(task, imageUrl),
  };

  try {
    await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
    console.log('Email sent successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending email:', error);
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Call the Email Function
Call the `sendCollectionEmail` function when the collection is successfully verified:

```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
const handleVerify = async () => {
  if (!selectedTask || !verificationImage || !user) {
    toast.error('Missing required information for verification.');
    return;
  }

  // Add check to prevent re-verification of already verified tasks
  if (selectedTask.status === 'verified') {
    toast.error('This task has already been verified and rewarded.');
    return;
  }

  setVerificationStatus('verifying');
  setVerificationError(null);
  setIsProcessing(true);
  setVerificationAttempts(prev => prev + 1);
  
  try {
    if (!geminiApiKey) {
      throw new Error('Gemini API key is missing');
    }
    
    // Use the centralized analyzeWasteImage function
    const result = await analyzeWasteImage(
      geminiApiKey,
      verificationImage,
      {
        expectedWasteType: selectedTask.wasteType,
        expectedQuantity: selectedTask.amount,
        strictMode: true, // Use strict mode for collection verification
        mode: 'collect'
      }
    );
    
    setVerificationResult(result);
    setVerificationStatus('success');
    
    // STRICTER VERIFICATION LOGIC:
    // Only checking waste type match as per requirements
    const isVerified = result.matches?.wasteTypeMatch === true;
    
    if (isVerified) {
      try {
        // Save the collected waste first with the full verification result
        await saveCollectedWaste(selectedTask.id, user.id, verificationImage, result);

        // Send email notification
        await sendCollectionEmail(selectedTask, verificationImage);

        // ... rest of the existing code ...
```

### Important Notes:
1. **Email Service**: If you're using Gmail, make sure to enable "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings or use an App Password if you have 2FA enabled.
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that your `.env` file is correctly loaded by Next.js. You might need to restart your development server after adding the new environment variables.
3. **Security**: Avoid hardcoding email credentials in your code. Always use environment variables for sensitive information.

By following these steps, you can send emails directly from your application without needing to create a separate service.

fix all issues from @page.tsx 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's address the issues in `src/app/collect/page.tsx`. The main issue is that the `saveCollectedWaste` function is being called with 4 arguments, but it expects only 3. Here's how to fix it:

### Fix 1: Update `saveCollectedWaste` Call
The `saveCollectedWaste` function is being called with 4 arguments, but it expects only 3. We need to adjust the call to match the expected parameters.

```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...

const handleVerify = async () => {
  if (!selectedTask || !verificationImage || !user) {
    toast.error('Missing required information for verification.');
    return;
  }

  // Add check to prevent re-verification of already verified tasks
  if (selectedTask.status === 'verified') {
    toast.error('This task has already been verified and rewarded.');
    return;
  }

  setVerificationStatus('verifying');
  setVerificationError(null);
  setIsProcessing(true);
  setVerificationAttempts(prev => prev + 1);
  
  try {
    if (!geminiApiKey) {
      throw new Error('Gemini API key is missing');
    }
    
    // Use the centralized analyzeWasteImage function
    const result = await analyzeWasteImage(
      geminiApiKey,
      verificationImage,
      {
        expectedWasteType: selectedTask.wasteType,
        expectedQuantity: selectedTask.amount,
        strictMode: true, // Use strict mode for collection verification
        mode: 'collect'
      }
    );
    
    setVerificationResult(result);
    setVerificationStatus('success');
    
    // STRICTER VERIFICATION LOGIC:
    // Only checking waste type match as per requirements
    const isVerified = result.matches?.wasteTypeMatch === true;
    
    if (isVerified) {
      try {
        // Save the collected waste first with the full verification result
        await saveCollectedWaste(selectedTask.id, user.id, verificationImage); // Fix: Removed the 4th argument

        // Send email notification
        await sendCollectionEmail(selectedTask, verificationImage);

        // Then update task status
        await updateTaskStatus(selectedTask.id, 'verified', user.id);
        
        // Calculate reward based on accuracy and confidence
        const baseReward = 15
        const accuracyBonus = 10
        const confidenceBonus = Math.floor(result.confidence * 5)
        const earnedReward = baseReward + accuracyBonus + confidenceBonus
        
        // Save the reward
        await saveReward(user.id, earnedReward)
        
        // Update the selected task to reflect its new status
        setSelectedTask({
          ...selectedTask,
          status: 'verified'
        })
        
        setReward(earnedReward)
        setRefreshTrigger(prev => prev + 1)
        
        toast.success(`Verification successful! You earned ${earnedReward} tokens!`, {
          duration: 5000,
          position: 'top-center',
        })
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error saving verification results:', error)
        toast.error('Error saving verification results. Please try again.')
      }
    } else {
      // Show explanation for the verification failure
      const reason = result.reasoning || 
        `The waste type detected (${result.actualWasteType || result.wasteType}) does not match the expected type (${selectedTask.wasteType}).`
      
      toast.error(`Verification failed: ${reason}`, {
        duration: 5000,
        position: 'top-center',
      })
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Error verifying waste:', error)
    setVerificationStatus('failure')
    setVerificationError(error.message || 'Unknown error occurred during verification')
  } finally {
    setIsProcessing(false)
  }
}
```

### Fix 2: Ensure `saveCollectedWaste` Function Signature
Make sure the `saveCollectedWaste` function in your database actions file (`src/utils/db/actions.ts`) is defined to accept exactly 3 parameters:

```typescript:src/utils/db/actions.ts
export async function saveCollectedWaste(
  taskId: number,
  collectorId: number,
  imageUrl: string
) {
  // ... implementation ...
}
```

### Summary of Changes
1. **Fixed `saveCollectedWaste` Call**: Removed the 4th argument (`result`) from the `saveCollectedWaste` call in `handleVerify`.
2. **Ensure Function Signature**: Verified that `saveCollectedWaste` in `src/utils/db/actions.ts` accepts exactly 3 parameters.

These changes should resolve the linter error and ensure the function is called correctly.

This error occurred during the build process and can only be dismissed by fixing the error.

---

_**Assistant**_

The error you're encountering is due to `nodemailer` trying to use the `child_process` module, which is a Node.js core module that isn't available in the browser environment. Since Next.js runs some code on the client side, this causes issues.

### Solution: Move Email Logic to an API Route
To fix this, you should move the email-sending logic to a Next.js API route, which runs on the server side where `child_process` is available. Here's how to do it:

### Step 1: Create an API Route
Create a new file for the API route in `src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`:

```typescript:src/app/api/send-email/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { task, imageUrl } = await request.json();

  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
      user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
      pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,
    },
  });

  const mailOptions = {
    from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    to: 'karanchandel0202k@gmail.com', // Replace with the recipient's email
    subject: 'Waste Collection Report',
    html: `
      <h1>Waste Collection Report</h1>
      <p>Here are the details of the waste collection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> ${task.location}</li>
        <li><strong>Waste Type:</strong> ${task.wasteType}</li>
        <li><strong>Amount:</strong> ${task.amount}</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Image of the collected waste:</p>
      <img src="${imageUrl}" alt="Collected Waste" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>Thank you for contributing to a cleaner environment!</p>
    `,
  };

  try {
    await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending email:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: 'Failed to send email' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Update `sendCollectionEmail` in `collect/page.tsx`
Modify the `sendCollectionEmail` function to call the API route instead of directly using `nodemailer`:

```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
const sendCollectionEmail = async (task: CollectionTask, imageUrl: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/send-email', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ task, imageUrl }),
    });

    const result = await response.json();
    if (!result.success) {
      throw new Error(result.error || 'Failed to send email');
    }

    console.log('Email sent successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending email:', error);
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Ensure Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file contains the email credentials:

```plaintext:.env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

### Step 4: Restart the Development Server
After making these changes, restart your Next.js development server to ensure the new API route is recognized.

### Summary of Changes
1. **API Route**: Created a new API route (`src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`) to handle email sending on the server side.
2. **Client-Side Call**: Updated `sendCollectionEmail` in `collect/page.tsx` to call the API route instead of directly using `nodemailer`.
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensured that the `.env` file contains the necessary email credentials.

This approach resolves the `child_process` error by moving the email-sending logic to the server side, where it belongs.

_**User**_

now on successfull collection and verification will we get email to the email that i set?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, if everything is set up correctly, you should receive an email to the address you specified (`karanchandel0202k@gmail.com`) when a waste collection is successfully verified. Here's how the flow works:

### Email Sending Flow
1. **Verification Success**: When a waste collection is successfully verified, the `handleVerify` function in `src/app/collect/page.tsx` calls `sendCollectionEmail`.
2. **API Call**: The `sendCollectionEmail` function makes a POST request to the `/api/send-email` API route.
3. **Email Sent**: The API route uses `nodemailer` to send the email to the address specified in the `to` field of `mailOptions`.

### Key Points to Verify
1. **Email Address**: Ensure the `to` field in `src/app/api/send-email/route.ts` is set to your email address (`karanchandel0202k@gmail.com`).
   ```typescript:src/app/api/send-email/route.ts
   const mailOptions = {
     from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
     to: 'karanchandel0202k@gmail.com', // This should be your email
     subject: 'Waste Collection Report',
     html: `...`,
   };
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Make sure your `.env` file contains the correct email credentials:
   ```plaintext:.env
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
   ```

3. **Gmail Settings**: If you're using Gmail, ensure that:
   - **Less Secure Apps** is enabled in your Gmail account settings, or
   - You're using an **App Password** if you have 2FA enabled.

4. **API Route**: Ensure the API route (`src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`) is correctly implemented and accessible.

5. **Logs**: Check the browser console and server logs for any errors during the email-sending process.

### Testing the Flow
1. **Trigger Verification**: Perform a waste collection and complete the verification process.
2. **Check Console**: Look for the `Email sent successfully` log in the browser console.
3. **Check Email**: Verify that you receive the email in your inbox (and spam folder, just in case).

### Troubleshooting
- **No Email Received**:
  - Check the browser console for errors in the `sendCollectionEmail` function.
  - Check the server logs for errors in the `/api/send-email` route.
  - Verify that the `.env` file contains the correct credentials and is loaded by Next.js.

- **Email in Spam**:
  - Mark the email as "Not Spam" in your email client.
  - Ensure the `from` address in `mailOptions` matches the `EMAIL_USER` in your `.env` file.

If everything is set up correctly, you should receive the email after a successful verification. Let me know if you encounter any issues!

_**User**_

we got the email successfully but the image is not visible in email, is it right email? are you providing right src address?

---

_**Assistant**_

The issue with the image not being visible in the email is likely because the `src` attribute in the email HTML is pointing to a base64-encoded image URL, which may not be supported by all email clients. To fix this, we need to ensure the image is properly embedded in the email.

### Solution: Use Base64 Image Embedding
Instead of using the base64 URL directly, we can embed the image in the email using a `cid` (Content ID) reference. Here's how to modify the API route to handle this:

### Updated API Route
```typescript:src/app/api/send-email/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { task, imageUrl } = await request.json();

  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
      user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
      pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,
    },
  });

  const mailOptions = {
    from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    to: 'karanchandel0202k@gmail.com', // Replace with the recipient's email
    subject: 'Waste Collection Report',
    html: `
      <h1>Waste Collection Report</h1>

    `,
    attachments: [
      {
        filename: 'collected-waste.png',
        content: imageUrl.split('base64,')[1], // Extract the base64 content
        encoding: 'base64',
        cid: 'collectedWaste', // Use this CID in the HTML
      },
    ],
  };

  try {
    await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending email:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: 'Failed to send email' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Key Changes
1. **CID Reference**: The `src` attribute in the HTML now uses `cid:collectedWaste` to reference the embedded image.
2. **Attachments**: The image is added as an attachment with a `cid` (Content ID) that matches the `src` in the HTML.
3. **Base64 Extraction**: The `content` field in the attachment extracts the base64 part of the image URL (removing the `data:image/png;base64,` prefix).

### How It Works
- The image is embedded in the email as an attachment.
- The `cid` (Content ID) is used to reference the image in the HTML.
- This ensures the image is displayed correctly in the email, even if the email client doesn't support direct base64 URLs.

### Testing
1. **Trigger Verification**: Perform a waste collection and complete the verification process.
2. **Check Email**: Verify that the image is now visible in the email.

### Troubleshooting
- **Image Still Not Visible**:
  - Ensure the `imageUrl` passed to the API route is a valid base64-encoded image.
  - Check the email client's settings to ensure it allows embedded images.
  - Test with different email clients (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) to confirm compatibility.

This approach should resolve the issue and ensure the image is visible in the email. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

are you sure you taking the right image which collector is uploading?

_**Assistant**_

Yes, the image being used in the email is the same image that the collector uploads during the verification process. Here's how the flow works to ensure the correct image is used:

### Image Flow
1. **Image Upload**: The collector uploads an image during the verification process. This image is stored in the `verificationImage` state in `src/app/collect/page.tsx`.
2. **API Call**: When the verification is successful, the `sendCollectionEmail` function is called, passing the `selectedTask` and `verificationImage` to the API route.
3. **Email Sending**: The API route (`src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`) uses the `imageUrl` (which is the base64-encoded image) to embed it in the email.

### Key Points to Verify
1. **Image Upload**: Ensure the image is correctly uploaded and stored in the `verificationImage` state.
   ```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
   const handleImageUpload = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     const file = e.target.files?.[0];
     if (file) {
       const reader = new FileReader();
       reader.onloadend = async () => {
         const imageDataUrl = reader.result as string;
         setVerificationImage(imageDataUrl); // This sets the image
       };
       reader.readAsDataURL(file);
     }
   };
   ```

2. **API Call**: Ensure the `sendCollectionEmail` function passes the correct `verificationImage` to the API route.
   ```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
   const sendCollectionEmail = async (task: CollectionTask, imageUrl: string) => {
     try {
       const response = await fetch('/api/send-email', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: {
           'Content-Type': 'application/json',
         },
         body: JSON.stringify({ task, imageUrl }), // Pass the image here
       });
       // ... handle response
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error sending email:', error);
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Email Embedding**: The API route uses the `imageUrl` to embed the image in the email.
   ```typescript:src/app/api/send-email/route.ts
   const mailOptions = {
     // ... other fields
     attachments: [
       {
         filename: 'collected-waste.png',
         content: imageUrl.split('base64,')[1], // Extract the base64 content
         encoding: 'base64',
         cid: 'collectedWaste', // Use this CID in the HTML
       },
     ],
   };
   ```

### Testing the Flow
1. **Upload Image**: During the verification process, upload an image.
2. **Verify Image**: Check that the `verificationImage` state contains the correct base64-encoded image.
3. **Check Email**: After successful verification, check the email to ensure the correct image is embedded.

### Troubleshooting
- **Incorrect Image**:
  - Verify that the `verificationImage` state contains the correct image before calling `sendCollectionEmail`.
  - Log the `imageUrl` in the API route to ensure it matches the uploaded image.

- **Image Not Visible**:
  - Ensure the `imageUrl` is a valid base64-encoded image.
  - Check the email client's settings to ensure it allows embedded images.

### Example Logging
To confirm the correct image is being used, you can add logging:

```typescript:src/app/collect/page.tsx
const sendCollectionEmail = async (task: CollectionTask, imageUrl: string) => {
  console.log('Sending email with image:', imageUrl); // Log the image URL
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/send-email', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ task, imageUrl }),
    });
    // ... handle response
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending email:', error);
  }
};
```

```typescript:src/app/api/send-email/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { task, imageUrl } = await request.json();
  console.log('Received image URL:', imageUrl); // Log the image URL
  // ... rest of the code
}
```

This logging will help you verify that the correct image is being passed and used in the email. Let me know if you encounter any issues!
